# Forge Review

Code review with fresh context. This skill is deliberately run without implementation context so it catches things the author missed due to familiarity bias.

Works in three modes:
- **Pipeline mode** — invoked with documentId, posts findings as issue comment, advances status
- **Subagent mode** — spawned by forge-code during Step 10, returns findings to caller
- **Standalone mode** — `/forge-review` with no args, reviews current branch diff

## Usage

```
/forge-review <documentId>    # pipeline — review + post comment + set status
/forge-review                  # standalone — review current branch diff
```

## Review Process

### 1. Enter Worktree & Get the Diff

**Always use a worktree** to isolate from parallel agent sessions:

```
EnterWorktree → { name: "ISS-XX-review" }
```

Then check out the ISS-* branch and get the diff:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout ISS-XX-*
git diff HEAD~N --stat
git diff HEAD~N
git log --oneline HEAD~N..HEAD
```

N = number of implementation commits (exclude previous review/fix commits).

### 2. Load Relevant Skills

Detect tech stack from changed files, then load only what applies:
- Strapi files → read `.claude/skills/strapi/SKILL.md`
- Next.js files → read `.claude/skills/nextjs/SKILL.md`
- Also read `forge/.forge/lessons.md` if it exists

### 3. Review Checklist

**Bugs & Logic** — wrong logic, null risks, race conditions, missing error handling
**Security** — injection, credentials in code, missing auth, unsanitized input
**Performance** — N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks, unbounded data
**TypeScript** — unsafe casts, `any` leaks, missing type narrowing
**React** (if applicable) — wrong useEffect deps, unmounted state updates, unstable keys
**Strapi** (if applicable) — document service usage, lifecycle loops, missing populate
**Consistency** — matches project patterns, web/dev parity if both changed

### 4. Output

```markdown
## Code Review — ISS-XX

| # | File | Line | Severity | Finding |
|---|------|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | path/to/file.ts | 42 | Bug | Description |
| 2 | path/to/file.ts | 88 | Minor | Description |

### Summary
- X bugs (must fix), Y minor (should fix), Z low (optional)
```

Severities: **Bug** (incorrect behavior), **Minor** (problematic pattern), **Low** (style/naming).

If clean: `No issues found. Implementation looks clean.`

**The review agent reports only — it does NOT fix code.**

### 5. Pipeline Exit (only when documentId provided)

Post findings as issue comment:
```
forge_comments → create → { data: { body: "<review output>", issue: "<documentId>", author: "Lapras" } }
```

- **No Bug findings** → check if branch pushed → `forge_issues → update → { data: { status: "deploying" } }`
- **Has Bug findings** → `forge_issues → update → { data: { status: "reopen" } }`

Then exit the worktree: `ExitWorktree → { action: "remove" }`

## Output Rules (Save Tokens)

- **Zero narration.** Don't announce each file you're reviewing. Just read the diff, analyze, output findings.
- **Findings go to the comment, not to chat.**
- **One-line status only.** "Review done: 2 bugs, 1 minor. Posted comment." — nothing more.
